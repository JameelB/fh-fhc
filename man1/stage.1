This command can be used to stage your FeedHenry applications, either to the \'development\' or \'live\' FeedHenry environment\. The \'\-\-clean\' flag can be used to do a full clean restage, which has the following effect: \- cleans out all old application log files \- will remove any cached node npm modules and do an \'npm install\' from scratch\.
